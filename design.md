# Design Document

## System Overview
The Smart Public Infrastructure Failure Predictor is an AI-enabled system designed to monitor infrastructure health, detect anomalies, and predict potential failures using IoT data and Machine Learning techniques. The system promotes preventive maintenance strategies.

## High-Level Architecture

The system is organized into four primary layers:

### 1. IoT Layer
Responsible for capturing real-world infrastructure signals.

Components:
- Sensors (vibration, pressure, temperature, etc.)
- Embedded devices (ESP32 / Arduino)
- MQTT communication protocol

---

### 2. Data Layer
Handles data ingestion, storage, and preprocessing.

Components:
- Data collection services
- Data cleaning & normalization modules
- Database (PostgreSQL / MongoDB)
- Cloud storage (AWS)

---

### 3. AI / Analytics Layer
Performs intelligent analysis and prediction.

Components:
- Feature engineering
- Anomaly detection engine
- Failure prediction models (LSTM, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Risk scoring system

---

### 4. Application Layer
User interaction and decision-support interface.

Components:
- Monitoring dashboard
- Alert management system
- Visualization & reporting tools
- Maintenance recommendation module
